When testing network applications locally, we use the loopback address 127.0.0.1 to ensure that the application can communicate with itself without needing an external network.
In the absence of a DHCP server, the system automatically assigns itself a link-local address from the range 169.254.0.0/16, allowing devices on the same local network to communicate.
To send a message to all devices on the local network, we can use the broadcast address 255.255.255.255, which ensures that every host receives the packet.
For internal networking, we often use private addresses such as 192.168.1.1, which are not routable on the public internet and help maintain network security.
When streaming video to multiple users, we utilize a multicast address like 224.0.0.1 to efficiently send the data to all subscribed clients without overloading the network.
When configuring a server to listen on all available interfaces, we specify the address 0.0.0.0, allowing it to accept connections from any IP address.
To route traffic to external networks, we set the default gateway to 192.168.1.1, which is the address of our router.
Certain IP addresses, such as 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, are reserved for future use and should not be assigned to any devices on the network.
In IPv6 configurations, we use the loopback address ::1 to test local applications, similar to how we use 127.0.0.1 in IPv4.
Devices on an IPv6 network automatically generate link-local addresses in the fe80::/10 range, allowing them to communicate with each other on the same local link without a global address.
