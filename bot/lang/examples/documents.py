We are born, and with time, we die.
We love, laugh, cry, and struggle to survive.
In dark times, some turn inward, to family, the state, or God.
Sooner or later, all rest beneath the sod.

While living, we each choose our path.
We can proceed, stand still, or look back.
Some bury themselves in the day-to-day.
Many look for greater meaning, or some "truer" way.
Our bodies rot, our minds decay, and all sand castles slip away.

With kids, we get slight reprieves - like more chances to continue the dream.
But in that dream, there lies a trap.
We forget, our kids need their our path.
To my kids, I say go forth - find your own way.
