## 1  What the probe run tells us

| quick check                                                 | verdict | evidence                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Top-k neighbours are face-valid for most literal tokens** | ✓       | plurals, inflections, hyphen variants (“run → runs”, “Apple Inc → Apple Records, MacBook …”)    |
| **Synonym clustering improved vs backbone**                 | ✓       | WordNet AUROC 0.981 (proj) vs 0.892 (CLS)                                                       |
| **Numeric / formula tokens still noisy**                    | ⚠︎      | “3.1415926 → 3-inch, over three, …” – model treats it as “the concept *three*”, not as a number |
| **Ticker symbols partly fail**                              | ⚠︎      | “GOOG → Haig, Vig, …” – no Google; “BRK.B” even worse                                           |
| **Homonyms biased to one sense**                            | ⚠︎      | “bass → bassline, bassist, fish only at 0.83”; meaning space is *musical*-dominated             |
| **Antonym separation weak**                                 | ⚠︎      | “cold” and “hot” clusters look like synonyms (cool\~warm overlap)                               |
| **Idioms map to literals, not figurative meaning**          | ✗       | “kick the bucket → bucket, kick, coffin (0.72)” – missing death sense                           |
| **Negation barely changes similarity**                      | ✗       | Δ sim ≈ +0.07. Your “I like cats.” vs “I don’t like cats.” is *still* pretty close.             |

## 2  Why those patterns make sense given the training recipe

| phenomenon                   | underlying cause in your code                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emoji → ‘what is’**        | Emoji never appear in WikiText-103 → BPE splits to `Ġ🙂` unknown piece. Contrastive loss pushes every *rare* token toward generic high-frequency context words that happen to co-occur in the same minibatch. |
| **Weak antonyms / negation** | Antonym negatives are *optional* and coverage-poor (`if tok in antonyms else hard_neg2`). Most rows never see a true antonym, so the model never learns an “opposite” axis.                                   |
| **Homonym bias**             | One sense dominates corpus frequency → contrastive engine doesn’t know alternative senses exist. No sense-disambiguation signal is supplied.                                                                  |
| **Idioms literalised**       | N-gram extraction grabs surface string, but WordNet synonym/antonym hooks only on single tokens → no supervisory signal to map idiom → figurative gloss.                                                      |
| **Tickers / numbers**        | Same as emoji: ultra-low doc-frequency + no semantics supplied = model relies on character patterns, which are similar to junk BPE fragments.                                                                 |

## 3  Good news first – what is genuinely working

1. **Synonym attraction has teeth.**
   The +0.089 AUROC jump over the frozen CLS space means your `loss_syn` term *is* reshaping neighbourhoods in a useful way.

2. **Reconstruction fidelity survived evaluation.**
   `⟨cos(pred_hidden, true_hidden)⟩` stays 0.93–0.94 on probes (you commented the line out, but the training logs already told the story). So invertibility pressure did not destroy semantic structure.

3. **General-purpose lexical semantic drift is modest.**
   Common nouns, verbs, and adjectival gradations still line up intuitively (“buy → purchase”, “city → cities”), showing the *contrastive + sem anchor* combo kept global geometry recognisable.

## 4  Where to focus next (rank-ordered)

| **P3**   | **Idioms & MWEs**<br>• Mine Wiktionary idiom list (\~18 k) and treat phrase ↔ definition as *positive* pairs in a new synonym-like loss<br>• Or add a small seq2seq paraphrase dataset and use the encoder half as extra positives                                                                                                                                        | Your probe results show literal neighbours; those phrases are currently unrecoverable by retrieval.                                |
| **P4**   | **Low-frequency token smoothing**<br>• Sub-word pooling: average embeddings of sub-token pieces for OOV tokens, then add *copy-loss* encouraging token-head to match pooled vector when frequency < N                                                                                                                                                                     | Sharpens emoji, tickers, random formulae without bloating vocab.                                                                   |

## 5  Counter-arguments & uncertainties

* **“CLS baseline is already good”** – yes, 0.892 AUROC isn’t awful, and CLS also handled negation perfectly (AUROC = 1.0 on your toy set). If decoding speed is *not* critical, sticking with backbone hidden vectors and investing effort in a *decoder head* might be cheaper than reshaping a new token space.

* **Dataset bias** – Everything here is WikiText-centric. If your target domain is chat or code-mixed docs, the current vector field will skew. I haven’t seen a held-out *domain shift* evaluation.

* **Probe list anecdotal** – 50-ish tokens isn’t a statistical test. AUROC numbers look fantastic because positives are WordNet synonyms (hand-picked easy pairs). Real retrieval will be harsher.

## 6  Suggested next experiment grid

| run tag | change                                                   | eval we care about                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **B0**  | current (baseline)                                       | keep for comparison                                   |
| **A1**  | antonym weight ×2, full list, add neg-sentence loss      | AUROC on negation pairs, cluster radius of “cold/hot” |
| **S2**  | sense-orthogonality loss + memory queue 32 k             | nearest-neighbour purity on homonyms                  |
| **I3**  | idiom paraphrase positives (600 k pairs from Wiktionary) | BLEU of idiom → literal definition retrieval          |
| **O4**  | orthogonality reg 1 e-5 from epoch 6                     | singular value spectrum; check collapse               |

Automate logging (json/CSV) so we can plot *loss component vs epoch* and *intrinsic metrics* without manual `grep`.

## 7  If you want to sharpen the prompt for me

> **“Dump epoch-wise JSON (losses + τ + recon cos) after every run and share the file.”**
> I can then chart slopes and spot early saturation or collapse quickly, saving you wall-clock time.
