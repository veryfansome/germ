what are the common pretraining tasks for LLMs?

---

# Response 1

Common pretraining tasks for large language models (LLMs) typically revolve around predicting or reconstructing textual data. Below are some widely used approaches:

1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**
    - In MLM, a portion of the input tokens are randomly masked. The model then learns to predict the masked tokens. This is used in models such as BERT.

2. **Causal Language Modeling (CLM) / Next-token Prediction**
    - This method involves predicting the next token in a sequence given all the previous tokens. GPT family models (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-3) use this approach.

3. **Permuted Language Modeling**
    - A variation (used in XLNet) that involves permuting the sequence of tokens and then predicting tokens in a specific factorization order.

4. **Denoising Autoencoding**
    - Similar to MLM but can include more sophisticated corruption strategies, such as shuffling and replacing segments. It aims to reconstruct the clean text given a corrupted input.

5. **Sentence/Document-level Tasks**
    - Beyond the token-level tasks, some models leverage tasks such as next-sentence prediction or sentence order prediction (e.g., BERT’s original next-sentence prediction) and document-level coherence objectives.

6. **Multitask Objectives**
    - Some training frameworks include additional objectives like image-text matching or other multimodal tasks, especially in models that venture beyond purely textual data. This can enhance language understanding and generalization.

let's say I want to train an encoder using a vocabulary of characters and use MLM (masking characters), CLM (predicting next character), word/chunk level tasks (predicting the next word), and denoising (removing all white spaces and having the model add them back) - is this feasible and what would such a model learn?

# Response 2

Yes, it is feasible to train an encoder with a character-level vocabulary and incorporate multiple training objectives such as:

1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM) on Characters:**  
   The model learns to recover missing parts of words or parts of the sequence from context. This helps capture local dependencies and morphological patterns at the character level.

2. **Causal Language Modeling (CLM) on Characters:**  
   By predicting the next character given all previous characters, the model learns sequential dependencies in the data. This objective reinforces learning the order of characters and helps model syntax implicitly through character-level context.

3. **Word/Chunk-Level Tasks:**  
   If you define tasks that predict the next word or chunk, even while training on characters, you introduce a higher-level semantic or syntactic structure into the learning process. This encourages the model to form abstractions that approximate word boundaries and overall sentence structure, despite operating on a subword (character) level.

4. **Denoising (Restoring Whitespace):**  
   Removing all whitespaces and training the model to add them back up (or recover the original segmentation) forces the model to learn about token boundaries and language segmentation. This is beneficial for understanding the structure of language at a higher level than individual characters.

### What Would Such a Model Learn?

- **Multi-Granular Representations:**  
  The model would develop representations at several linguistic levels:
    - **Character-Level:** It learns fine-grained details like morphology, spelling patterns, and even some phonetic hints that affect language comprehension.
    - **Subword/Word-Level:** Through tasks that require predicting whole words or chunks, it learns how lower-level character combinations form semantically meaningful units.
    - **Structural Patterns:** With objectives like denoising whitespaces, the encoder learns about sentence structure and the boundaries that define meaning in a language.

- **Robustness and Flexibility:**  
  Combining these different objectives can make the model more robust to noise and errors. For instance, it might be better at handling misspellings or irregular input since it has been trained on multiple granularities of language.

- **Contextual Understanding:**  
  While character-level models typically struggle with long-range dependencies, the addition of word/chunk-level tasks can help bridge the gap, allowing the model to capture context over longer sequences as it learns higher-level grouping and semantic information that goes beyond individual characters.

- **Implicit Segmentation and Tokenization:**  
  The denoising task forces the model to implicitly learn how to segment text into meaningful units (i.e., where spaces or word boundaries belong), reducing the reliance on external tokenization even when using a character vocabulary.

### Challenges to Consider

- **Complex Training Dynamics:**  
  Incorporating multiple objectives requires careful balancing. You might need to adjust loss weights or design a multi-task training schedule to ensure that none of the tasks dominate the others.

- **Computational Complexity:**  
  Training at a character level can lead to longer sequences, which might increase computational load. The added word/chunk-level tasks can mitigate some efficiency issues but also require additional architectural considerations to reconcile different levels of representation.

- **Evaluation Complexity:**  
  Since the model is learning various levels of granularity, evaluating its performance may require a suite of metrics that assess both fine-grained (character-level accuracy) and coarse-grained (semantic or syntactic understanding) aspects.

In summary, such a model would learn rich, multi-layered representations that capture both low-level (character) details and higher-level (word/chunk/sentence) structures. This could lead to robust language understanding capable of handling diverse types of input and noise.

would the embeddings of such a model be invertible? would else might be needed to maximize invertibility?

---

The short answer is that the embeddings produced by such a model would not be strictly invertible by default. Here are some details:

1. **Many-to-One Nature:**  
   When you convert discrete tokens (in your case, characters) into continuous embeddings, you’re typically using a lookup table (or learned embeddings) where many different tokens might be mapped into separate vectors. That mapping, even if it is injective at the token level, becomes non-invertible when subsequent layers (e.g., convolutional or transformer layers) process these embeddings and mix information across positions. There's an inherent many-to-one transformation in such architectures, meaning that you lose some information that would allow you to uniquely recover the original token sequence.

2. **Information Loss in Transformation:**  
   Even if you design a model to approximate inversion (for instance, using a decoder or an autoencoder structure), intermediate embeddings are often a compressed representation of the input. This compression generally entails loss of fine-grained details, which means that exact reconstruction of the original input (i.e., invertibility) is not guaranteed.

3. **Architectural Choices for Maximizing Invertibility:**  
   To maximize the recoverability or invertibility of the embeddings, you might consider some or all of the following:

    - **Autoencoder Objectives:**  
      Train using an explicitly defined reconstruction loss where the model is required to reconstruct the original input exactly from the embeddings. This encourages the network to preserve information necessary for inversion.

    - **Invertible Neural Networks:**  
      Architectures like reversible residual networks or normalizing flows are designed so that each transformation is invertible. These models can sometimes be configured to have an inherently invertible mapping between input and representation space. However, these architectures can be computationally expensive and might not scale as easily as standard transformer models.

    - **Loss Functions Encouraging Information Preservation:**  
      Using additional regularization or auxiliary losses that encourage retention of specific details might help improve the invertibility of embeddings.

    - **Skip Connections or Latent Concatenation:**  
      Keeping more direct paths between the input and deeper layers (such as residual connections) helps preserve information that can be used during reconstruction.

In summary, while traditional encoder embeddings in language models are not designed to be strictly invertible, incorporating explicit reconstruction losses or using invertible architectures can push the system towards a more reversible mapping.
