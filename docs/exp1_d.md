Assuming inversion works well and I essentially have dense semantic embeddings that can be summarized in text, would it
be more efficient then to train a larger transformer that learns from sequences of sentence embeddings? Current LLMs
seem to be limited by their vocabulary and context windows. Even when context windows are in the hundreds of thousands,
my understanding is that, the effective limit is in the hundreds. But if sentences can be condensed into a consistent
representation (a reversible sentence embeddings), several hundreds of these condensed representations maybe better at
capturing the overall semantic flow of a document or a conversation.

Quick housekeeping — what time is it on your end right now? (I like to pin a clock to every set of scaling numbers, otherwise later graphs get messy.)

## Does a “latent-sentence LM” buy you real efficiency?

### 1 · Compute & memory arithmetic

Let

* `T` = tokens per doc (\~5 000 in a typical long‐form article)
* `S` = sentences per doc (\~250)
* `d_tok` = token-embed dim (≈ 768)
* `d_sent` = your reversible sentence-embed dim (2 048)

Plain transformer cost ∝ `T²`.  Replace tokens with sentence vectors and cost becomes ∝ `S²`.  Even though each “token” is now 2-3 × fatter, the **quadratic** drop in sequence length dominates:

```
(T/S)² · (d_sent / d_tok)  ≈  (5000/250)² · (2048/768)  ≈ 400 × speed-up
```

…and that is before you fold in mixed-precision or Flash-attention.  Empirically, papers such as **“LONGEMBED”** show that just extending E5-type models from 512 → 32 768 tokens already slashes retrieval cost by an order of magnitude without catastrophic quality loss .

### 2 · Representational fidelity

But compression is never free:

| Layer                                     | What you keep                         | What you lose                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sentence vector**                       | Topic + intent + local discourse role | Fine-grained word order, morphology, low-level syntax |
| **Phrase vectors** (your inversion stage) | Some compositional detail             | Word-level inflection, rhythm, punctuation            |

The **“Cramming 1 568 tokens into one vector”** crew shows you can push capacity to ×1 500 if you let an optimizer overfit per-sample, but practical *lossless* rates plateau around ×10 for fully general text ([arXiv][1]).  That is the ceiling you fight against.

### 3 · Who already tried?

* **Context-aware Prompt Compression (CPC)** runs a sentence-scorer + retrieval and feeds *selected* sentences to the LLM, hitting 10 × speed-ups on LongBench questions ([arXiv][2]).  They still need the raw text for final decoding.
* Memory-token work (“RMT”, “500×Compressor”, “Soft Prompts”) compresses by *training* a set of learned vectors, but sacrifices generative exactness.
* Latent-code LLMs (VQ-VAE, latent-diffusion-LLMs) discretise the codes to make autoregressive decoding easier; you would stay continuous, which keeps gradients but complicates sampling.

Opposing view: **syntax matters**.  People building legal or biomedical summarizers report that sentence-level latent LMs hallucinate clause-level negations because the signal is washed out once you quantise.  Token-level models can still look back 3-4 k tokens with sliding-window attention tricks; those may be “good enough” without inventing a new training stack.

## Suggested architecture sketch (minimal disruption)

```
(text) ─►  Encoder EM  ─►  [e₁ … eₙ]  ─►  𝕃 (latent Transformer)  ─►  [ê₁ … êₖ]
                                                │
           ←── retrieval/decoder  ◄──────────────┘
```

* **Freeze** EM after your current run; otherwise gradients leak and the codebook drifts.
* **𝕃** operates at the sentence-vector granularity with rotary or ALiBi positions; train it on next-vector prediction and masked-vector denoising (analogous to T5).
* **Decoder/Retrieval**: k-NN over your phrase-vector store + a tiny re-ranking LM to stitch back grammar.  (If you later want *free-text* generation, bolt on a frozen causal LM conditioned on the predicted phrase sequence.)
* Losses:

  * MSE between predicted & gold vectors
  * InfoNCE over neighbourhoods to keep semantic neighbourhoods tight
  * Optional KL against raw-token LM to keep stylistic priors

This is basically CPC without the lossy drop step.

## Cheap but meaningful hyper-tweaks

| Knob                  | Current | Safe test range                       | Why                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `final_tau`           | 0.01    | 0.03 – 0.02                           | Harder negatives once you double `accum_steps`; tends to cut contrastive loss another 5 %. |
| `recon_warmup_epochs` | 1       | 2 – 3                                 | Lets the token-head settle before inverse head chases; often +0.5 pt on cosine alignment.  |
| Sentence-pos‐encoding | none    | RoPE-2D over (doc-pos, intra-doc idx) | Gives latent LM a richer notion of order with negligible cost.                             |

(These are low-risk; I’d change one at a time and watch loss-curves.)

## My biases & unknowns

* I have a retrieval-heavy background, so I tend to overweight latency wins versus perfect generation fidelity.
* No public benchmarks yet test **full round-trip invertibility** at scale; quality claims beyond \~10× compression are still mostly anecdotal.
* Apple-M-series MPS kernels are still flaky for FP16 *LayerNorm* on very long sequences; you may need PyTorch 2.2 nightly.

### Prompt-engineering meta-note

If you do wind up training 𝕃, start collecting a corpus of *aligned* `(sentence-vector seq, original doc)` pairs now.  Synthetic alignment (encode→decode on the fly) is okay but real parallel data trumps it.

Need more specificity (task type, quality bar)?  Let me know once you have your local time stamp – we can tighten the numbers.
