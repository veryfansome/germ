Great question ‚Äî picking the right **starter project** makes reinforcement learning (RL) much easier to digest. Since RL involves concepts like environments, agents, policies, rewards, and exploration vs. exploitation, you‚Äôll want a project that‚Äôs:

* **Simple enough** to let you focus on core ideas, not heavy math or coding overhead.
* **Rich enough** to show you why RL is useful.
* **Well-supported** with libraries/tutorials so you can debug and compare your results.

Here are a few strong starter projects:

---

## 1. **Multi-Armed Bandit Problem**

* **Why it‚Äôs good:** Simplest RL problem ‚Äî no states, just actions and rewards. You learn exploration vs. exploitation (Œµ-greedy, UCB, Thompson sampling).
* **Implementation:** A slot machine with 5‚Äì10 arms, each with a different (hidden) reward probability.
* **What you‚Äôll learn:** How different strategies affect learning efficiency, regret minimization, and convergence.

---

## 2. **Gridworld Navigation**

* **Why it‚Äôs good:** Small 2D environment, easy to visualize.
* **Implementation:** A 5√ó5 grid where an agent moves up/down/left/right to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles.
* **What you‚Äôll learn:** Value iteration, Q-learning, SARSA, policy iteration.
* **Extension:** Add stochastic moves or negative-reward traps to test robustness.

---

## 3. **CartPole Balancing (OpenAI Gym classic)**

* **Why it‚Äôs good:** The ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù of deep RL. The agent balances a pole on a cart by pushing left or right.
* **Implementation:** Use `gymnasium` (successor to OpenAI Gym) + `stable-baselines3`.
* **What you‚Äôll learn:** How to train agents with Deep Q-Networks (DQN), policy gradients, and PPO.
* **Difficulty:** Harder than Gridworld because you need function approximation (neural nets).

---

## 4. **FrozenLake (Gym environment)**

* **Why it‚Äôs good:** Discrete states + probabilistic outcomes.
* **Implementation:** Agent must cross a frozen lake without falling in. States are limited (16 tiles in 4√ó4).
* **What you‚Äôll learn:** Transition dynamics, stochasticity, and why exploration matters.

---

## 5. **Taxi-v3 (Gym environment)**

* **Why it‚Äôs good:** More complex than FrozenLake but still discrete and manageable.
* **Implementation:** A taxi agent must pick up and drop off passengers at the right locations.
* **What you‚Äôll learn:** State encoding, Q-tables, and scaling beyond tiny grids.

## Suggested Path

1. **Bandits ‚Üí FrozenLake ‚Üí Taxi ‚Üí CartPole**

   * Start with bandits (pure exploration vs. exploitation).
   * Move to FrozenLake/Taxi (tabular Q-learning).
   * Graduate to CartPole (neural networks + deep RL).

2. Along the way, try:

   * **Œµ-greedy** vs. **softmax action selection**
   * Q-learning vs. SARSA
   * Tabular vs. function approximation

üëâ If you want, I can sketch a **step-by-step curriculum with code snippets** (NumPy for tabular RL, PyTorch for deep RL). Would you like me to lay out such a structured path, including code examples for each step?
